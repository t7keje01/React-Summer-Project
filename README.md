# React-based Summer Project: The Arcade Website!

## What is the project: 
This React-based website was created after completing the Meta Front-End Developer -certificate, thus reflecting upon the learning experience. It was designed for an arcade; thus, its primary target would be those who enjoy playing games.

## Which technologies and tools were used in the project: 
The website was created with the help of React. Other tools used were Bootstraps and various CSS techniques. Since this was one of my first websites, it mostly focused on trying out various, different options.

## Who did what parts of the project: 
This project was done solo.

## Application architecture, database schema, APIs, maybe ABIs, UI/UX plan, protocols:  
This was a Front-End project. No major database was used except for an JSON bin and regarding API’s, fetch and post methods were used. UI/UX was supposed to be more comprehensive, but unfortunately had to be cut down due to lack of time.

## Instructions how to deploy and use the project code: 
The code is mostly done, with some minor fixes needed. To use the code, one needs to change the available dates that’s being used via API. Currently the most recent available date is 19.9.2023 so the code works until that day. If trying to use the code beyond that, you should create and replace the used external data.

## Link to the server / service where the project is/was running: 
http://localhost:3000/ was used while creating the website.
